**Game Concept: Melodic Block**

In *Melodic Block*, players navigate a maze of musical blocks, each representing a different note or sound. The goal is to create harmonic paths by activating blocks in the right order, forming melodies that unlock new areas and progress through the game.

**Key Features:**

1. **Musical Blocks:** Some blocks emits a unique musical note (C, D, E, F, etc.) when player is on the note and plays it. Players must connect blocks in a specific sequence to form harmonious melodies or chords.
   
2. **Grid Manipulation:** Players can move, rotate, or interact with blocks to change their pitch, tone, or position. This influences the puzzle environment, unlocking paths or activating mechanisms.
   
3. **Sound-based Triggers:** Some blocks act as buttons, triggering actions in the environment like opening gates, moving obstacles, or changing the maze layout when activated in the correct order.

4. **Harmonic Progression:** Players will need to align themselves with blocks in a way that forms chords or sequences. Wrong notes will alert players with off-key sounds, guiding them toward the correct path.

5. **Interactive Puzzles:** As players progress, theyâ€™ll face more complex puzzles involving rotating blocks, timed sequences, and multi-step interactions, requiring strategy and experimentation to solve.

**How It Works:**
- Players move through the maze, triggering blocks that produce notes or collecting new notes to play themselves. One note may be picked up at a time to form harmonies with other spaces
- They need to activate blocks in the correct order to create melodies, unlocking doors or altering the environment.
- Buttons and environmental blocks provide additional layers of interactivity, allowing players to manipulate the grid or change block states to reach new areas.

**Gameplay Fun:**
- Combining logical reasoning with musical creativity, players experiment with sound and sequence to progress through dynamic puzzles.
- Challenges increase in complexity, with timed elements and multi-step solutions keeping the gameplay fresh and engaging.

In *Melodic Block*, solving puzzles is not just about reaching the goal but about experimenting with the sound you collect while navigating the maze.

NOTES:

funcionality ideas:

    moving across blocks to play melody - timing element 

    note pickup permanance - note is no longer on the tile when you pick it up

    moving notes after when replacing note under player

    Players can move, rotate, or interact with blocks to change their pitch, tone, or position. This influences the puzzle environment, unlocking paths or activating mechanisms.

    starts with single melody, unmovable tiles, then sticky tiles that are not dropped, then moveable tiles can be introduced that replace the tile being picked up

    looping mechanic, player plays melody then can push L to loop it
block types:
   abyss1 -> player can hang off ledge over this type of block

   wall1(squidwall) -> normal wall, cannot hang over edge

   note block -> when the PLAY key is pressed the note under the players block is playeed along with the note attached to player, if any.


Level x: 
    first melody for key / checkpoint: A, A, F, D, F
